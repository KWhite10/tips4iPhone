# Pre-work - tips4iPhone

tips4iPhone is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Kasey White

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Implemented slider that gives a broader range of tip percentages
- [x] Implemented a different colored background

## Notes

Getting used to the layout of xcode took a some time.
Also at one point I deleted the segmented button which caused linking errors that took some time to find and resolve.
